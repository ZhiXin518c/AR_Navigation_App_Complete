# AR Navigation App Design Document

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the design and architecture for an augmented reality indoor navigation application built primarily for iOS using ARKit, with considerations for Android ARCore implementation. The application will provide users with intuitive, visual navigation assistance within indoor environments such as shopping malls, airports, hospitals, and office buildings.

Based on our research findings, ARKit offers superior performance, accuracy, and reliability compared to ARCore, making it the primary development target. The app will utilize visual markers as the primary positioning technology due to their high accuracy and cost-effectiveness, supplemented by ARKit's Location Anchors where available.
